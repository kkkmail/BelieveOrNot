            <h2>‚ô† Trump Selection</h2>
            <p>At the start of each round, one player becomes the "King" and chooses the trump suit:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The King rotates each round (player 1, then 2, then 3, then 4, repeat)</li>
                <li>Trump cards beat all non-trump cards</li>
                <li>Higher trump cards beat lower trump cards</li>
                <li>Choose wisely - trump selection affects the entire round!</li>
            </ul>
