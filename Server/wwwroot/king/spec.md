## Basic Game Flow

1. **Deal Phase**: Distribute 8 cards to each player
2. **Round Play**: Follow trick-taking rules with specific avoidance/collection goals
3. **Scoring**: Calculate points based on current round type
4. **Early Termination**: Check if round can end early (when applicable)
5. **Next Round**: Continue through all rounds in sequence
6. **Game End**: Player with highest total score wins

## Trick-Taking Rules

- **Following suit**: Must follow suit if possible
- **Leading**: Winner of previous trick leads next
- **Trick**: A set of 4 cards (one from each player) that goes to one player
- **First player rotation**: At the start of each new round, the first player shifts by one position clockwise
- **First round**: First player is assigned randomly
- **Special Hearts rule**: Cannot lead with Hearts in "Don't take Hearts" round unless no other suit available
- **King of Hearts rule**: Must discard King of Hearts when you cannot follow suit in avoiding rounds

## Collecting Phase Trump Rules

- **Trump selection**: Each player chooses trump suit when it's their turn to lead the round
- **Trump order**: Players take turns in rotation (each gets equal opportunities)
- **Trump power**: Trump cards beat all non-trump cards regardless of rank
- **Trump vs Trump**: Higher rank wins when both cards are trump

## UI Requirements

- **Card display**: Show player hands and table
- **Score tracking**: Display current scores and round type  
- **Round indicator**: Show which type of round is being played and current round number
- **Trump indicator**: Show current trump suit during Collecting Phase
- **Game log**: Track important moves and penalties
- **Early termination notice**: Indicate when a round ends early

## Technical Considerations

- **Real-time multiplayer**: 4 players in same game
- **Turn management**: Ensure proper turn order
- **Score calculation**: Accurate point tracking across rounds
- **Rule enforcement**: Prevent illegal moves (Hearts leading, King holding)
- **Early termination logic**: Implement round ending conditions
- **Trump handling**: Manage trump suit selection and card comparison
