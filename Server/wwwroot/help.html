                <li>Add 0-4 Jokers to the deck</li>
                <li>All cards are dealt evenly among players</li>
                <li>Any four-of-a-kind in your starting hand are automatically discarded</li>

            <h2>🃏 How to Play</h2>
            <h3>Playing Cards</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>On your turn, play 1-3 cards face-down to the center pile</li>
                <li>The first player declares what rank they're playing (e.g., "Kings")</li>
                <li>All subsequent players must play (or claim to play) the same rank</li>
                <li>You can tell the truth or bluff about what you actually played!</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Challenging</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Before the next player's turn, you can challenge the previous player</li>
                <li>Click on one of their face-down cards to flip it</li>
                <li>If the card matches the declared rank (or is a Joker), you were wrong and collect all cards</li>
                <li>If the card doesn't match, you were right and they collect all cards</li>
                <li>The player next after the one who collected the cards goes next</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="rule-section">
            <h2>🏁 Round Ending</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A round always ends with a challenge - never with a card play</li>
                <li>When players have no cards left, the game continues until only one player has cards</li>
                <li>The last player with cards must challenge the most recent play</li>
                <li>Multiple players can end with zero cards, but the round only ends after a challenge</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="rule-section">
            <h2>🃏 Special Rules</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Jokers:</strong> Count as any rank and always match the declared rank</li>
                <li><strong>Four-of-a-Kind:</strong> Automatically discarded when you get 4 of the same rank</li>
                <li><strong>2-Player Endgame:</strong> When one player is out, the other can still challenge</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="rule-section">
            <h2>🏆 Winning & Scoring</h2>
            <h3>Round End</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Players with 0 cards get +5 points (winner bonus)</li>
                <li>Each regular card remaining: -1 point</li>
                <li>Each Joker remaining: -3 points</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Game End</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Play multiple rounds and track cumulative scores</li>
                <li>Highest score wins when the game creator ends the game</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>💡 Strategy Tips</h2>
            <ul>

                <li>Save Jokers for when you really need them (they always work!)</li>
                <li>Sometimes it's worth challenging even if you're not sure</li>
                <li>Bluff confidently - hesitation gives you away!</li>

                <li>Remember: rounds always end with challenges, so plan accordingly</li>
