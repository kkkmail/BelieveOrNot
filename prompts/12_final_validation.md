Final validation and cleanup:

1. Run the complete test suite:
   - Execute: `dotnet test --verbosity normal`
   - Ensure all tests pass
   - Review test coverage

2. Validate against specification:
   - Check all rules from sections 4-7 are implemented
   - Verify all validation rules from section 14
   - Confirm all acceptance criteria from section 17

3. Create integration smoke tests:
   - TestCompleteGameFlow(): Full game from start to finish
   - TestAllDeckSizes(): 32, 36, 54 card configurations
   - TestEdgeCases(): All boundary conditions

4. Performance and stress testing:
   - Test with maximum players
   - Test with large numbers of concurrent matches
   - Verify no memory leaks

5. Documentation:
   - Update README with build/run instructions
   - Document API endpoints
   - Include example game flows

6. Final build verification:
   - `dotnet build --configuration Release`
   - `dotnet test --configuration Release`
   - Ensure clean build with no warnings
